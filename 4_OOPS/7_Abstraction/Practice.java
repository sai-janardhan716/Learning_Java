        1) Create an abstract class Vehicle with abstract method startEngine().
        Extend it in Car and Bike classes and implement startEngine() differently.

        2) Define an interface Shape with method area().
        Implement it in Circle and Rectangle classes.

        3) Create an interface Playable with method play().
        Implement in Guitar and Piano classes.

        4) Make an abstract class Employee with abstract method calculateSalary().
        Extend it to FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee classes.
