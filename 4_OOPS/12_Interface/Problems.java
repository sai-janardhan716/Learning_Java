            1) Payment Gateway
            • Create an interface Payment with methods pay(double amount) and refund(double amount).
            • Implement two classes:
                -> CreditCardPayment
                -> UpiPayment
            • Each class should print appropriate messages for pay and refund.

            2) Vehicle Abilities
            • Create two interfaces:
                -> Drivable (method drive())
                -> Flyable  (method fly())
            • Implement a class FlyingCar that implements both interfaces.
            • Demonstrate driving and flying actions.

            3) Shape Calculations
            • Define an interface Shape with:
                -> double area()
                -> double perimeter()
            • Implement classes Circle and Rectangle to calculate area and perimeter.

            4) Music Player
            • Define an interface Playable with methods play() and stop().
            • Implement two classes:
                -> Mp3Player
                -> Radio
            • Each class prints its own play and stop messages.

            5) Sports Scoring
            • Create an interface Scorable with method getScore().
            • Implement classes:
                -> Cricket (return runs)
                -> Football (return goals)
            • In main, create objects of both and display their scores.
