        Practice Problems – this & super
        ---------------------------------
        1) Rectangle
        • Create a class Rectangle with fields length and breadth.
        • Use a constructor where parameters have same names as instance variables.  
          -> Use `this` to differentiate between them.
        • Create a method area() that returns length × breadth.

        2) Circle
        • Create a class Circle with field radius.
        • Provide two constructors: default (radius = 1) and parameterized.  
          -> Use constructor chaining with `this()` to call the default constructor from the parameterized one.

        3) Person & Employee
        • Create a parent class Person with a method display() that prints "I am a person".
        • Create a subclass Employee that overrides display() to print "I am an employee".
        • In Employee's display(), first call the parent method using `super.display()` and then print the child message.

        4) Vehicle & Car
        • Vehicle has a field speed and a constructor to initialize it.
        • Car extends Vehicle and has an additional field brand.
        • Use `super` in the Car constructor to call Vehicle’s constructor and initialize speed.

        5) Animal & Dog
        • Animal class has a method sound() that prints "Animal makes a sound".
        • Dog extends Animal and overrides sound() to print "Dog barks".
        • Create another method in Dog that calls the parent’s sound() using `super.sound()`.
