            -> Wrapper classes are object representations of primitive data types in Java.
            -> They allow primitives (like int, char, double) to be used as objects, enabling them to work with Collections, Generics, and Object-oriented features.
            Purpose:
            -> To convert primitive data types into objects and vice versa.
            -> Useful for working with data structures (like ArrayList, HashMap) that store objects only.
