            -> LinkedList is part of the java.util package.
            -> It is a doubly linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
            -> Unlike ArrayList (which uses a dynamic array), LinkedList stores elements as nodes.
            -> Each node contains:
                   - Data
                   - Address of previous node
                   - Address of next node
            -> It is useful when frequent insertions and deletions are required.
