                  The element that is added last will be removed first.
            -> Imagine a stack of plates in your kitchen.
                 - You put a plate on top -> that’s push().
                 - You remove the top plate -> that’s pop().
                 - You can only take or see the top plate, not the middle ones.
            -> Example of Real Life:
                1) Undo feature in text editors,
                2) Browser back button,
                3) Function call stack in Java.
