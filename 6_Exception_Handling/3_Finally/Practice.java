            1) FileClosing
            • Try to read a file that does not exist.
            • Catch FileNotFoundException.
            • In finally block print "Closing file resources".

            2) DivisionWithReturn
            • Create a method that divides two integers.
            • Use try block to return result.
            • Catch ArithmeticException if divisor is 0.
            • finally block prints "Division attempt finished".

            3) MultipleCatchFinally
            • Take an integer from user.
            • Perform array access and division in try.
            • Catch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and ArithmeticException.
            • finally block prints "Execution completed".

            4) DBConnectionCleanup
            • Simulate DB connection by printing "Connected to DB".
            • Force an exception (divide by zero).
            • Catch the exception.
            • finally block prints "DB Connection Closed".

            5) NestedTryFinally
            • Use nested try blocks.
            • Inner try throws and catches an exception.
            • Inner finally prints "Inner finally executed".
            • Outer finally prints "Outer finally executed".

            6) SystemExitEffect
            • Print "Start" in try block.
            • Call System.exit(0) inside try.
            • finally block prints "This will not print if System.exit is called".
