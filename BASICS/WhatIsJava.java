    1)What is Java?
    ----------------
    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is platform-independent (bUt JVM is platform dependent), meaning that Java code can run on any system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    In short:
    ->Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
    ->Strongly typed and secure.
    ->Designed for portability, scalability, and reliability.
    
    2)Who created Java & when?
    --------------------------
    ->Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1991 (initially called Oak).
    ->It was officially released in 1995 as Java 1.0.
    ->In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and now maintains Java.
    
    3)Why is Java so famous?
    ------------------------
    Java gained huge popularity because of:
    ->Platform Independence – Java code runs on any device with JVM.
    ->Object-Oriented – Makes code reusable, modular, and maintainable.
    ->Huge Community & Libraries – Rich API and frameworks for faster development.
    ->Performance & Security – JVM + bytecode verification ensures safe execution.
    ->Versatility – From desktop apps to enterprise systems, Android apps, and cloud services.

    4)Applications & Use Cases of Java
    -----------------------------------
    Java is everywhere andnhere are Some real-world applications:
    ->Enterprise Applications – Banking, insurance, healthcare systems.
    ->Mobile Apps – Android apps (majority built using Java or Kotlin).
    ->Web Applications – Server-side apps using Spring, JSP, Servlets.
    ->Big Data – Hadoop ecosystem and tools use Java.
    ->Cloud & Distributed Systems – Java powers many cloud-native apps.
    ->Embedded Systems & IoT – Smartcards, sensors, devices.
    ->Game Development – Games like Minecraft were originally written in Java.

    5)How Java Works?
    ------------------
    ..Java works on the principle of compilation + interpretation:
    1)Write Code – A programmer writes .java file (source code).
    2)Compilation – The Java Compiler (javac) converts the code into Bytecode (.class file).
    3)Execution on JVM – The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets and executes the bytecode.
    4)JVM is platform-specific, but bytecode is platform-independent.

    This is why Java programs can run anywhere with JVM.

    Flow:
    Java Source Code (.java) → Compiler → Bytecode (.class) → JVM → Runs on OS
